Datasets
=============

MHD-based model data files (*.npy) can be found in ``/modeling/cn`` and
``/modeling/cs`` and it should be downloaded separately, on the directory that the code will be run.


Optional: virtual sc trace file
* Note that this file does not need to be manually generated if spacecraft orbit is available on SSCWeb.
* text format: (without header)
* yy/mm/dd HH:MM:SS x y z, as in SSCWeb (x,y,z in GSE Earth radii)
